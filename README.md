This repository contains code used to prepare the manuscript for the
package [{coiaf}](https://github.com/bailey-lab/coiaf). It includes the
following folders and files:

-   `benchmarking` contains various files used to benchmark our software
    package and the resulting figures.
-   `coiaf-real-data` is a git submodule pointing to the repository used
    to analyze sequencing data using coiaf.
-   `misc-figures` contains code for various figures.
-   `sensitivity-analysis-stats.Rmd` contains code to compute statistics
    on our sensitivity analysis results. Note that the code to generate
    the sensitivity analysis results and the resulting figures are
    included as vignettes in the coiaf package.
